Pressure sensor always shows minval as 100, need to redo or find bug//FIXED, added numeric_limits so any sensor range is now valid
Need input-validation//no change needed for now as far as i can tell, forgot i added one in last assignment for load
Need to add threshold, threshold has user write in the name of the sensor, would prefer to just have user choose between sensors
will make it work for now but good change to make in the future if i can figure out how to make that work
Need to find leftovers from assignment 1 to remove/fix/remake
Might need to move parts of code to own file or restructure for cleaner code
Need to test program more as i've just confirmed it works at a base level and nothing else
Need a readme
