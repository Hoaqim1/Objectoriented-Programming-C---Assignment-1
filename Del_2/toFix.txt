Pressure sensor always shows minval as 100, need to redo or find bug//FIXED, added numeric_limits so any sensor range is now valid
Need input-validation//no change needed for now as far as i can tell, forgot i added one in last assignment for load
Need to add threshold 
Need to find leftovers from assignment 1 to remove/fix/remake
Might need to move parts of code to own file or restructure for cleaner code
Need to test program more as i've just confirmed it works at a base level and nothing else
Need a readme
